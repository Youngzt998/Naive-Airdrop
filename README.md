# PC-Android-File-Synchronization
Currently, main contributors of the project are all naive undergraduate students, please tolerate any mistakes or bugs which might be stupid for an experienced developer.

## Preview

There might be a situation where we expect our computer to automatically synchronize some files on our mobile phone, with out using USB or manually operating, though sometimes, we do not trust a company's application, or even don't trust the Global Internet. We might want to simplify the file transition to a local area. 

This project implement a mini file synchronization system between Windows (written in python) and Android OS. It works without the whole Internet but only in a local area network (within the same Wi-Fi, in fact).  The final goal includes auto connection, auto detecting changes of the observing files on client devices,  encyption in transfer, etc.

We aim to finish two program currently:

0. Server Program on Windows
1. Client Program on Android

[Surely there's other "transition pair" such as iOS - WIndows , Android-MacOS, or even iOS- MacOS if you donnot trust Airdrop...]
