# Naive-Airdrop
Currently, i am just a naive undergraduate students (In fact, its both my first Java project and my first Python project...), please tolerate any mistakes or bugs which might be stupid for an experienced developer.

## Preview

There might be a situation where we expect our computer to automatically synchronize some files on our mobile phone, with out using USB or manually operating, though sometimes, we do not trust a company's application, or even don't trust the Global Internet. We might want to simplify the file transition to a local area. 

This project implement a mini file synchronization system between Windows (written in python) and Android OS. It works without the whole Internet but only in a local area network (within the same Wi-Fi, in fact).  The final goal includes auto connection, auto detecting changes of the observing files on client devices,  encyption in transfer, etc.

We aim to finish two program currently:

0. Server Program on Windows
1. Client Program on Android

[Surely we can try other "transition pair" such as iOS - WIndows , Android-MacOS, or even iOS- MacOS if you donnot trust Airdrop...]



## Environment

Windows 10: Python 2.7

Android: Java in Android Studio



## Server-on-PC



## Client-on-Android
